# American Sign Language translation App

This Python application detects American Sign Language (ASL) gestures and translates them into English text in real-time. It utilizes a machine learning classification model based on Random Forest to accurately recognize hand signs and map them to their corresponding English letters or words, enabling seamless communication between sign language users and non-signers.
